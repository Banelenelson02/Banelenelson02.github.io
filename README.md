# Hi there 👋, I'm Banele Nelson Ntuli

I'm a Computer Science student based in Pretoria. I love building websites and real-world projects using:

- 💻 HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ☕ Java
- 🗃️ SQL

I'm currently learning and growing my GitHub with useful, clean projects to showcase my skills and growth.  
When I’m not coding, I’m probably watching football (Manchester City fan!), learning something new, or working on a cool idea.

### 🔨 Projects I'm working on:
- A personal portfolio website
- A SPAR-like eCommerce front-end
- Mini Java programs and database apps
